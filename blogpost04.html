        <p>
            Democracy operates on twin principles of truth and trust. From 10,000 years ago to the 21st century, human
            societies evolved from particularized and selected trust circles to generalized and universalistic trust
            spheres which are the backbone of democracy. From authoritarianism to democracy, human beings expanded their
            circle of trust from a particular community to a global community. Autocrats established heated rhetoric
            that favour some ethnicity, ideology or racial superiority. Democracy prevailed in post-Cold War societies
            because it extended the trust of the people in universal institutions and global appeal. In the 21st
            century, democracy is in the backseat because of fading trust of societies and appealing lingual, ethnic and
            selected community rhetoric. The struggle for expanded empathy and advancement is overshadowed by regional
            and nationalistic interests. Democracy appeals for its universal struggle for recognition of all. The
            alleged intervention of Russia in the parliamentary elections in Italy and the presidential one in France
            through cyber-attacks and disinformation compromised the autonomous decision-making of the people which
            halted the democratic transition and empowered the populist leaders derailing the democracy. The digital
            malice and digital manipulation to sabotage democratic transition is a vivid manifestation of compromised
            democratic transition in the global order. In the 21st century, digital spaces, through social media, and
            engineered tactics has impeded democracies and appealed to populism and nationalism, while also giving rise
            to autocracies by fading trust of people in institutions, constitutions and rule of law.

            Particularized trust constitutes small alliances within a small subset of society, e.g. alliance of China
            and Russia. In democracies, generalized trust establishes large-scale trust that extends market relations,
            human progress and trade, e.g. alliances between and among European states. The citadel of democracy in the
            20th century was sustained through the extending circle of trust in the society. Information technology and
            science have subdued this trust in contemporary times. The complex and integrated societies are economically
            linked together. The equation of economic dependency established peace and prosperity in recent decades due
            to which democracies sustained. In contemporary times, the digital disorder and digitally dependent
            economies are vulnerable to trust. As the modern markets become digitally dependent, the threat of
            cyber-attacks and financial costs has grown in the last decade which is problematic for the integration of
            the system and overall democratic sustainability because modern democracies are founded on economic growth
            together. In 2021, a gang named Dark Side attacked American oil provider 'Pipeline through cyberspace. This
            Pipeline provides 45% of fuel to the East Coast of the United States. After the shutdown of supply, the
            people flocked to gas stations and it created social anarchy, leading to distrust which threatened the
            digital economy and the trust in economic institutions which act as the backbone of democracies in the
            modern world.
            Institutional harmony plays a key role in modern democracies. The digital disorder and cyber-attacks
            fomented distrust in the institutions. The data of different institutions - ranging from banks to government
            institutions - is hacked and used as a proxy to campaign against the government institutions. This creates a
            small fraction of people with particularized trust to destabilize the institutions and question their
            integrity. The most beautiful structure of democracy is global altruism and the spirit to work together in a
            human network for the progress of humanity. In the 21st century, cyber-attacks target the cohesion of human
            bonds that build trust between the people and their communities.
            Coming to the truth factor of democracies, the rampant disinformation and echochambering of in-group and
            outgroup divisions compromised the democracies in the current century. Through social media campaigns, the
            engineering of misinformation and malignant campaigns against the institutions, governance and democracy by
            the forces of authoritarianism and populism created divisions in society. The truth is fading from society
            due to digital deregulation and galvanized mass campaigns to inculcate distrust and fear in the people. The
            tussles between China and America, between Russia and America, and between Pakistan and India have resulted
            in barrages of disinformation and distrust in the society which is a lethal threat to democracy.
            In 2016, Russia allegedly interfered in the US presidential elections and especially targeted the campaign
            of Hillary Clinton through cyber-hacks. Nowadays, the world is struggling to win global order through
            digital detox. The intrigues to sabotage the democratic transition and affect voting turnout impede the way
            democracies flourish and sustain. The states try to destabilize the enemy country's governing institutions
            through hacking and data leaks. The sudden shutdown of electricity in the entire country stakes the trust of
            people in the incumbent institutional governance. Through cyber-attacks, the entire system can be paralyzed
            and made to operate per the whims and wishes of an enemy state which jeopardizes the overall sovereignty of
            the country. In this way, the digital spaces are used to backslide public trust in the institutions, further
            affecting the stability of democracy in any country.
            The concocted information about the state governance and institutions through fake accounts and hacking
            vanquish the people's belief in the leaders and politicians that spurs the anti-state and anti-government
            rhetoric. The direct intervention of a state to capture other state's sovereignty through military might has
            become irrelevant in this century. The digital capture is the way now to defeat the other state through
            cyber warfare. The elimination of trust and truth from any society fulfils the ulterior motives of an enemy
            state.
            It took humans 10,000 years to find a way to progress and end the violent conflicts in the 20th century by
            establishing democracies and universal governance through UN and World Bank-like institutions. The world is
            again facing anarchy due to expanded technologies and cyber inventions. Democracies are backsliding to
            authoritarianism because the foundational elements of democracies like trust and truth are being
            compromised. The defeat of hereditary monarchies, fascism and communism paved the way for democracies. In
            2022, democracies are facing international rifts and global push due to the rising manipulation of
            undemocratic forces for the populist appeal. In this century, we can move towards the universal struggle of
            democracies by regulating social media, media literacy and control of Big Data. The uncontrollable and
            excessive digital disorder can create social dysfunction and space for wars and conflicts as they are
            getting traction in the form of the Ukraine and Taiwan issues. Digital control is a panacea for democracies
            in the 21st century,
