            It’s an undeniable fact that startups make our world a better and smarter place. Take Uber, Airbnb, Zoom,
            LinkedIn and other solutions that we actively use on a daily basis. They turn communication, employment,
            traveling, shopping and working activities to a whole new level.

            No wonder each year the number of startups increases and breaks new records. According to the recent
            statistics, as of 2022 there are more than 70,000 startups in the US. And as of July 2022, there are more
            than 1,100 startups worldwide with a valuation of over $1billion.

            However, it is not a secret that not every startup becomes a unicorn. Most of them fail at early stages. And
            this happens mostly because they build projects that either do not meet market needs or do not satisfy
            demanding users.

            On top of that, project development is a risky venture and many startups end up losing a lot of money and
            struggling with attracting further investments. But do not worry, we know how to avoid a startup failure and
            we’ll tell you everything you need to know.

            Since our company specializes in custom software development for startups and growing businesses, we’d like
            to share with you some secrets of successful startups. We will cover up how to turn a brilliant project idea
            into a scalable product, what to do to make your solution a perfect market fit, and how to make your
            development journey less bumpy and challenging.

        <h3>Why startups need reliable development vendors</h3>
        <p>
            As we’ve already mentioned, for many startups software development can become a huge failure. But this is
            not necessarily going to happen if you hire an experienced and cohesive development team to build your
            project.

            You may have a clear vision of your project and particular business goals, but if you lack technical
            background you need someone to rely on and know that they will do a 100% great job. After all, you are
            putting your budget, time and perhaps even reputation at stake.

            If you take a look at the statistics, you’ll discover that the first reason why 42% of startups fail is
            because of incorrectly defined market needs. 29% of all failures are a result of funding and budget loss.
            And based on our experience, we can say that at least 62% of failures are caused by bad quality of product.
            That is why it is so important to find dedicated teams and developers with relevant expertise to minimize
            all possible risks.

            Development companies not only build high-quality solutions, they also bring so much more to the successful
            startups. They take care of:

        <ul>
            <li>
                market research to help you identify real pain points and demand and make highly competitive and useful
                project;
            </li>
            <li>
                project scalability and opportunities for further growth;
            </li>
            <li>
                all technical documentation that will help you set deadlines, track progress, and be sure that
                everything goes according to plan;
            </li>

            <li>
                proper estimation and budget calculation so that no penny was lost and your investors were satisfied;
            </li>
            <li>
                effective communication so that you can always receive all updates and have space for negotiating all
                matters;
            </li>

            <li>
                right development approach so that you can suggest changes and they will not affect product quality,
                budget and deadlines;
            </li>
            <li>
                all security measures and industry-related compliances;
            </li>

            <li>

                visually pleasing and user-friendly design that will be created according to the recent trends and with
                your brand identity in mind;
            </li>

            <li>
                maintenance of your solution and its improvements according to the feedback of the real users.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
