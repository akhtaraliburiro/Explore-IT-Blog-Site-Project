        <p>
            Technology is one of the strategic factors driving the increasing use of the Internet by terrorist
            organizations and their supporters for a wide range of purposes, including recruitment, financing,
            propaganda, training, incitement to commit acts of terrorism, and the gathering and dissemination of
            information for terrorist purposes. While the many benefits of the Internet are self-evident, it may also be
            used to facilitate communication within terrorist organizations and to transmit information on, as well as
            material support for, planned acts of terrorism, all of which require specific technical knowledge for the
            effective investigation of these offences. So, it can be asserted that the use of the Internet for terrorist
            purposes is a rapidly growing phenomenon, requiring a proactive and coordinated response from countries
            across the globe.
            Since the late 1980s, the Internet has proven to be a highly dynamic means of communication, reaching an
            ever-growing audience worldwide. The development of increasingly sophisticated technologies has created a
            network with a truly global reach, and relatively low barriers to entry. Internet technology makes it easy
            for an individual to communicate with relative anonymity, quickly and effectively across borders, to an
            almost limitless audience. The benefits of Internet technology are numerous, starting with its unique
            suitability for sharing information and ideas, which is recognized as fundamental human right. It must also
            be recognized, however, that the same technology that facilitates such. communication can also be exploited
            for the purposes s of terrorism. The use of the Internet for terrorist purposes creates both challenges and
            opportunities in the fight against terrorism as while the internet can be used for terrorism, it can also
            help fight the menace.


        <h3> How it is used for terrorism </h3>
        <p>
            There are six means by which the internet is often used to promote and support terrorism:
            1. propaganda (including recruitment, radicalisation and incitement to terrorism);
            2. financing.
            3. training.
            4. planning (including through secret communication and open-source information);
            5. execution; and
            6. cyber-attacks.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Propaganda </h3>

        <p>

            practical instruction, explanations, justifications or promotion of terrorist activities. These may include
            virtual messages, presentations, magazines, treatises, audio and video files and videogames developed by
            terrorist organizations or sympathizers. Further, the dissemination of propaganda is generally not, in and
            of itself, a prohibited activity. One of the basic tenets of international law is the protection of
            fundamental human rights, which include the right to freedom of expression. This guarantees an an individual
            the right to share an opinion distribute content which may be considered objectionable by others, subject to
            certain limited object exceptions. Nonetheless, the fundamental threat posed by cat pysty terrorist
            propaganda relates to the manner in which it used and the intent with which it is disseminated. Terrorist
            propaganda distributed via the Internet covers a range of objectives and audiences. It may be tailored,
            inter alia, to potential did, to actual supporters or opponents of an organization or shared extremist
            belief, to direct or indirect victims of acts of terrorism or to the international community or a subset
            thereof. Propaganda aimed at potential or actual supporters may be focused on recruitment, radicalization
            and incitement to terrorism, through messages conveying pride, accomplishment and dedication to an extremist
            goal. It may also be used to demonstrate the effective execution of terrorist attacks to those who have
            provided financial support.
        </p>


        <h3>2. Financing‚Äù</h3>
        <p>
            Terrorist organizations and supporters may also use the Internet to finance acts of terrorism. The manner in
            which terrorists use the Internet to raise and collect funds and resources may be classified into four
            general categories: direct solicitation, e-commerce, the exploitation of online payment tools and through
            charitable organizations. Direct solicitation refers to the use of websites, chat groups, mass mailings and
            targeted communications to request donations from supporters. Websites may also be used as online stores,
            offering books, audio and video recordings and other items to supporters. Online payment facilities offered
            through dedicated websites or communications platforms make it easy to transfer funds electronically between
            parties. Funds transfers are often made by electronic wire transfer, credit card or alternate payment
            facilities. Financial support provided to seemingly legitimate organizations, such as charities, may also be
            diverted for illicit purposes. Some terrorist organizations have been known to establish shell corporations,
            disguised as philanthropic undertakings, to solicit online donations.



        <h3> 3. Training


        </h3>

        <p>
            In recent years, terrorist organizations have increasingly turned to the Internet as an alternative training
            ground for terrorists. There is a growing range of media that provide platforms for the dissemination of
            practical guides in the form online manuals, audio and video clips, information and advice. These Internet
            platforms also provide detailed instructions, often in easily accessible. multimedia format and multiple
            languages, on topics such as how to join terrorist organizations; how to construct explosives, firearms or
            other weapons or hazardous materials; and how to plan and execute terrorist attacks. The platforms act as a
            virtual training camp. They are also used to share, inter alia, specific methods, techniques or operational
            knowledge for the purpose of committing an act of terrorism.

        </p>
        </p>



        <h3> 4. Planning ‚Äù</h3>
        <p>

            In the modern times, almost every case of terrorism involves the use of Internet technology. In particular,
            planning an act of terrorism typically involves remote communication among several parties. A case in point
            is from France titled as Public Prosecutor v. Hicheur, which illustrates how different forms of Internet
            technology may be used to facilitate the preparation of acts of terrorism, including via through
            communications within and between organizations promoting violent extremism, as well as across borders. The
            ability of the Internet to bridge distances and borders, and the vast amount of information publicly
            available in cyberspace, make the Internet a key tool in the planning of terrorist acts.
        </p>

        <h3> 5. Execution </h3>
        <p>

            Elements of the categories described above may be employed in the use of the Internet for the execution of
            terrorist acts. For example, explicit threats of violence, including in relation to the use of weapons, may
            be disseminated via the Internet to induce anxiety, fear or panic in a population or a subset of the
            population. Internet communications may also be used as a means to communicate with potential victims or to
            coordinate the execution of physical acts of terrorism. The use of the Internet in furtherance of the
            execution of acts of terrorism may, inter alia, offer logistical advantages, reduce the likelihood of
            detection or obscure the identity of responsible parties. Internet activity may also facilitate the
            acquisition of items necessary for the execution of the attack.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Cyberattacks </h3>
        <p>

            A cyberattack generally refers to the deliberate exploitation of computer networks as a means to launch an
            attack. Such attacks are typically intended to disrupt the proper functioning of targets, such as computer
            systems, servers or underlying infrastructure, through the use of hacking, advanced persistent threat
            techniques, computer viruses, malware, phlooding or other means of unauthorized or malicious access.
            Cyberattacks may bear the characteristics of an act of terrorism, including the fundamental desire to instil
            fear in furtherance of political or social objectives.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Countering terrorist activity through the Internet
        </h3>
        <p>
            The terrorists' use of the internet is a transnational problem, requiring an integrated response across
            borders and among national criminal justice systems. The United Nations plays a pivotal role in this regard,
            facilitating discussion and the sharing of Planning In the modern times, almost every case of terrorism

            Cyberattacks A cyberattack generally refers to the deliberate exploitation of computer networks as a means
            to launch an attack. Such attacks are typically intended to disrupt the proper functioning of targets, such
            as computer systems, servers or underlying infrastructure, through the use of hacking, advanced persistent
            threat techniques, computer viruses, malware, phlooding or other means of unauthorized or malicious access.
            Cyberattacks may bear the characteristics of an act of terrorism, including the fundamental desire to instil
            fear in furtherance of political or social objectives. Countering terrorist activity through the Internet
            The terrorists' use of the internet is a transnational problem, requiring an integrated response across
            borders and among national criminal justice systems. The United Nations plays a pivotal role in this regard,
            facilitating discussion and the sharing of good practices among member states, as well as the building of
            consensus on common approaches to combating the use of the internet for terrorism. The applicable
            international legal framework related to counterterrorism is contained in a range of sources, including
            resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, treaties, jurisprudence and customary
            international law.
            While terrorists have developed many ways to use the Internet in furtherance of illicit purposes, their use
            of the Internet also provides opportunities for the gathering of intelligence and other activities to
            prevent and counter acts of terrorism, as well as for the gathering of evidence for the prosecution of such
            acts. A significant amount of knowledge about the functioning, activities and sometimes the targets of
            terrorist organizations is derived from website, chat room and other Internet communications. Further,
            increased Internet use for terrorist purposes provides a corresponding increase in the availability of
            electronic data which may be compiled and analysed for counter-terrorism purposes. Law enforcement,
            intelligence and other authorities are developing increasingly sophisticated tools to proactively prevent,
            detect and deter terrorist activity involving the use of the Internet. The use of traditional investigative
            means, such as dedicated translation resources for the timely identification of potential terrorist threats,
            is also expanding.
            Online discussions provide an opportunity to present opposing viewpoints or to engage in constructive
            debate, which may have the effect of discouraging potential supporters. Counter-narratives with a strong
            factual foundation may be conveyed through online discussion forums, images and videos. Successful messages
            may also demonstrate empathy with the underlying issues that contribute to radicalization, such as political
            and social conditions, and highlight alternatives to violent means of achieving the desired outcomes.
            Strategic communications that provide counter-narratives to terrorist propaganda may also be disseminated
            via the Internet, in multiple languages, to reach a broad, geographically diverse audience.

        <h3>
            Intelligence-gathering
        </h3>


        <p>
            Tools in the commission of terrorist offences involving the internet and technological advancements have
            provided many sophisticated means by which terrorists may misuse the internet for illicit purposes.
            Effective investigations relating to internet activity rely on a combination of traditional investigative
            methods, knowledge of the tools available to conduct illicit activity via the internet and the development
            of practices targeted to identify, apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators of such acts.
            A case from France illustrates how different types of investigative techniques, both traditional and
            specifically relating to digital evidence, are employed in unison to compile the necessary evidence to
            successfully prosecute terrorist use of the internet.
            The investigation and prosecution of cases involving digital evidence requires specialist criminal
            investigation skills, as well as the expertise, knowledge and experience to apply those skills in a virtual
            environment. While the admissibility of evidence is ultimately a question of law and, therefore, within the
            remit of the prosecutors, investigators should be familiar with the legal and procedural requirements to
            establish admissibility for the purposes of both domestic and international investigations.
            A sound working knowledge of the requirements of applicable rules of evidence, and in particular with
            respect to digital evidence, promotes the collection of sufficient admissible evidence by investigators to
            support the successful prosecution of a case. For example, the procedures used in gathering, preserving and
            analyzing digital evidence must ensure that a clear "chain of custody" has been maintained from the time it
            was first secured, so that it could not have been tampered with from the moment of its seizure until its
            final production in court.
            Internet-based communication includes voice-over Internet protocol, electronic mail, online messenger
            services and chat rooms, file-sharing networks and cloud technology. Other investigations include data
            encryption and anonymizing techniques, wireless technology, investigations of terrorist cases involving the
            Internet, a systematic approach to investigations involving the Internet, tracing an IP address, specialized
            investigative utilities and hardware, forensic data preservation and recovery, and supporting the
            authentication of digital evidence.
            The operational cybercrime units include national or regional cybercrime units, computer forensic triage
            units, intelligence gathering and training.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Prosecution
        </h3>
        <p>
            The role of prosecutors in the prosecution of terrorism cases has become increasingly complex and demanding
            In addition to responsibility for the conduct of criminal proceedings, prosecutors are becoming more
            involved in the investigative and intelligence-gathering phases of terrorism cases, providing guidance or
            supervision on the legal and strategic implications of various investigative techniques.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Private sector cooperation
        </h3>
        <p>
            While the responsibility for countering the use of the internet for terrorist purposes ultimately lies with
            a state itself, the cooperation of key private sector stakeholders is crucial to effective execution.
            Network infrastructure for internet services is often owned, in whole or in part, by private entities.
            Similarly, private companies typically own the social media platforms that facilitate the dissemination of
            user-generated content to a broad audience, as well as popular Internet search engines, which filter content
            based on user-provided criteria, cooperation with government authorities, data retention, websites and other
            platforms hosting user-generated content, Internet search engines, monitoring services, public-private
            partnerships. Since the level of government regulation of the Internet varies greatly among states, in the
            absence of a global, centralised authority responsible for Internet regulation, private stakeholders such as
            service providers, websites hosting user-generated content and internet search engines continue to play an
            important role in controlling the availability of terrorism related content disseminated via the Internet.

        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>


        <p>
            With the increasing use of technology and the proliferation of smart phones and gadgets, the number of
            cybercrimes has increased manifolds. The speed, global reach and relative anonymity with which terrorists
            can use the Internet to promote their causes or facilitate terrorist acts, together with complexities
            related to the location, retention, seizure and production of Internet related data, makes timely and
            effective international cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies an increasingly
            critical factor in the successful investigation and prosecution of many terrorism cases. So, changing
            digital trends have exacerbated the need for robust cybersecurity practices and systems that keep computer
            systems and electronic data safe. In a world where more and more of our business and social lives are
            online, getting hacked isn't just a direct threat to confidential data, it can also ruin relationships and
            brands, and even result in significant legal jeopardy.
