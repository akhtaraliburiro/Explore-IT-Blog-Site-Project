        <p>
            Change is a sine qua non in the evolution of human society; hence, inevitable, and constant. Most recent
            change is underscored by the technological upshots. It has become appallingly obvious that our technology
            has exceeded our humanity. Presently, technology is transforming everything around us, from enterprises to
            societies and everything in between. In the past decade, digital transformation has gained significance as
            all avenues tried to digitalize themselves and endeavored to excel in their respective fields. From the
            Cloud and artificial intelligence to blockchain and big data and the Internet of Things, digital
            technologies are defining and redefining how we live, think and work. They are expanding the purview of the
            potential in terms of new inventions, services and business models, as well as the processes that facilitate
            these new offers.
            Apeek into the history reveals that digital technologies had advanced more rapidly than any innovation in
            our history – reaching around 50 percent of the developing world's population in only two decades and
            transforming societies. Technology can be a great equalizer as it is promoting multiple things, e.g., trade
            and connectivity. Technology is impacting multiple sectors of life. In the health sector, for instance,
            multiple technologies are helping to save lives, diagnose diseases and extend life expectancy. In education,
            online learning environments and distance learning have opened programs to students who would otherwise be
            excluded. Public services are also becoming more accessible and accountable through blockchain-powered
            systems, and less bureaucratically burdensome. Big data can also support more responsive and accurate
            policies and programs. However, those yet to be connected remain cut off from the benefits of this new era
            and remain further behind. The use of algorithms can replicate and even amplify human and systemic bias
            where they function on the basis of data which is not adequately diverse. Lack of diversity in the
            technology sector can mean that this challenge is not adequately addressed. It has become imperative for
            businesses to adapt and act fast- pivoting processes and operations to survive and build resilience for a
            sustainable future ahead. Digital transformation needs to be at the top of the priority list as a long-term
            investment, keeping in view the current dynamics. At present, enterprises must re-imagine their future and
            get on board intelligent digital re-engineering. Humans and machines must harmonize with each other to
            propagate more innovative, agile and adaptable economies and enterprises.

        <h3>Post-pandemic digitalism is rising:</h3>
        <p>
            As a post-pandemic new normal, Covid-induced digitalized events are expected to continue. However, in-person
            communication and physical activities may resume only to the extent where the businesses can accrue most
            benefits such as sharing tacit knowledge or to capture social value. A recent report by UNCTAD on Covid-19
            and e-commerce finds that, while global trade in goods and services declined amidst the pandemic, the share
            of the e-commerce industry in global retail increased up to 17 percent in 2020. This trend is most likely to
            continue throughout the recovery times from the disease. The report also suggests that digitalization of
            buyers and sellers helped reduce the negative impacts of lockdown on the economy. While the e-commerce
            sector and digital trade has been dominated by developed countries, Covid-19 has also steered up the process
            in developing countries since last year, particularly in Asia. For instance, China's online retail share
            increased from 19 percent to almost 25 percent. Similarly, Thailand witnessed an almost 60 percent increase
            in downloading of online shopping apps in just one week during March 2020.
        </p>

        <h3>The future of consumer Technology</h3>


        <p>
            As said, the future lies in technology and will keep on doing rounds. The future of the human-technology
            interface is reliant on the fact that every business whether it is hospitality, education, logistics, food &
            beverage, personal care, and myriad others is a technology business. Digital touch points are being inserted
            at every step of the customer journey from awareness to realization to advocacy. Interactive kiosks,
            radio-frequency identification tags, virtual reality. simulations, and computer vision are examples of how
            immersive human-technology interactions are in business-to-customer (B2C) models. However, the distant
            digital brand experience will not continue to be the only norm. In the next 18 to 24 months, we will witness
            in- person and digital experiences to be more intertwined than ever before. Custome journeys will constitute
            offline transactions with integrated digital elements to elevate brand experience and hyper-personalization.
            A more digital world, therefore, must be coupled with a more connected and networked society.
        </p>

        <h3> Moving towards a faster future</h3>
        <p>Man is futuristic. Many parts of his futuristic vision are already a reality. With just a single click, we
            can buy anything we want from e-commerce platforms that offer a huge range of products from around the
            world. New distribution channels such as direct-to-consumer bring products from the manufacturer directly to
            our homes. Products are made in smart factories that use sensors and micro-cameras to optimize production
            and energy efficiency in real time. Advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning
            are solving problems and helping to make our lives more convenient. Blockchain technology is making our
            world faster and more transparent by simplifying interactions between digital processes.
        </p>


        <h3>Transforming human and machine interactionl </h3>
        <p>If everything is connected to the internet, cyber security solutions will have to keep pace with the digital
            transformation so companies and individuals can be certain that their personal information stays safe. And
            it will be equally important to develop big data solutions with the power to make sense of the mountain of
            data generated by a fully connected world - by using advanced algorithms to make predictions and identify
            potential problems ahead of time. The interfaces between people and machines will shape our digitized
            future. Data, digital tools and technologies will not be able to accomplish the transformation alone. On the
            contrary, it is only through interaction and the human perspective and expertise - the ability to process
            emotions, understand context and find creative solutions that the full potential of modern technologies will
            be realized. The success of digital transformation of companies is primarily shaped by the company and
            leadership culture. Is there room to try new things, to experiment, and to fail? And how is collaboration
            and networking promoted within and outside the company? The crucial interfaces of digital transformation
            exist not only between people and machines, but also between companies and the experts within a company and
            across companies.

        </p>

        </p>



        <h3>Current digital transformation</h3>
        <p>
            Transformation is the spice of the life and change is the spirit of the world, and technology is doing both.
            The pandemic proved to be devastating for several organizations as their business collapsed. But, on the
            other hand, the crisis also accelerated the adoption of technology within various industries across the
            globe. The major integration of technology into the traditional business structures has led to the rise of
            certain trends that have the potential of dictating the future of digital transformation.
        </p>

        <h3>#5 Development speed and quality of solutions </h3>
        <p>We always offer optimal team composition for every startup so that the desired project can be developed as
            soon as possible without compromising its quality. We have experienced business analysts, project managers,
            developers, QA specialists, DevOps and marketing experts that take all efforts to deliver high-class
            solutions in 3-6 months and make it a perfect market fit.

            We estimate the project and identify how many specialists of what seniority are required to write clean
            code, perform all kinds of testing and release products on time.


        </p>
        <h3>5G becomes a reality</h3>
        <p>
            Various generations have produced myriads of benefits. 5G is in the lead role now. In the post-pandemic
            world, work in the digital platform has become the new normal, and organizations are increasingly attempting
            to operate their business from remote environments. While the concept of 5G had been in discussion in the
            past year itself, it is expected to become a technological prominence. As this network is expected to
            provide unprecedented speed and connectivity to the users, it is capable of providing a reliable connection.
            The mainstreaming of 5G connectivity can enhance the user experience and improve the process of digital
            collaboration which subsequently will accelerate the digital transformation. 5G will connect almost
            everything and everyone on the planet at a rapid speed. It will make it possible for traffic lights in smart
            cities to communicate with the cars on the road. These connected vehicles, powered by electricity instead of
            fossil fuels, will use self- driving technology to guide us safely to our smart homes.
        </p>
        <h3> Development of blockchain</h3>
        <p>
            Blockchain is a new normal in the digital world. The rapid technological advancement in the wake of Covid-19
            has brought the concept of blockchain to the limelight. While the concept has emerged from the understanding
            of cryptocurrency, it is increasingly being adopted and implemented in several other industries especially
            into the structure of financial institutions. The capabilities of the Blockchain are continually being
            contemplated by organizations all over the world. It is expected that Blockchain might play a crucial role
            in cybersecurity and might be increasingly used in industries in the future
        </p>

        <h3>
            Cybersecurity supersedes the priority list
        </h3>


        <p>
            Cybersecurity has gained prominence in the world. Security of any sorts breeds confidence of all sorts. The
            pandemic led to a major shift of business from the traditional forms of business into the digital platform.
            This resulted in the increased use of vulnerable data. among organizations. In addition to this, consistent
            cyber attacks on organizations across the globe have brought the concept of cybersecurity into the
            limelight. It is becoming a very crucial issue for companies across the globe. The increasing investment in
            cybersecurity is a future trend within digital transformation.
        </p>


        <h3> Digital banking transpires</h3>
        <p>
            The finance and banking sector's digital transformation was the most affected among the industries during
            the pandemic. The strict government guidelines forced the banking sector to provide most of its important
            services through the digital platform. The increasing adoption of digital transformation can be expected
            within this sector to improve the digital banking processes and enhance customer experiences.
        </p>
        <h3>Growth of the multi-cloud system</h3>
        <p>
            In the post-pandemic world, organizations are increasingly moving to the cloud platform. This will
            inadvertently lead to the growth of the multi-cloud system. As the system has the potential to remove the
            common issues faced by providers and the vendor lockins, multi-cloud systems can be expected to flourish
            increasingly shortly and shape the process of digital transformation.
        </p>


        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            To conclude, I would put: 'Modern problems have modern solutions' turns out to be true as swift
            digitalization brought with it a number of challenges and limitations. While the digital infrastructure is
            at its infancy stage, it has already created a digital divide in society. In the Inclusive Internet Index
            2020, Pakistan ranked at 76th out of 100 countries with only 35 percent of population having access to the
            internet. This has magnified the gap between the privileged and the unprivileged, skilled and unskilled,
            urban and rural. The tech-savvy will be ahead of those with limited or no access to digital tools. The world
            of work is undergoing radical change. Business has become a real-time experience, we deal with a relentless
            stream of messages and communications, and weoperate in a network of teams. Traditional top-down hierarchy
            is rapidly going away as young professionals demand more opportunities, leadership, and responsibility.
            Cutting-edge tools and solutions can provide answers to the biggest challenge of our time - the urgent need
            to cut resource consumption and protect our planet for future generations. In factories, for example, data
            about how much water or energy is being used can be gathered and analyzed in real time to identify
            opportunities to cut waste and minimize emissions. Data from production sites is collected and made
            available in a global digital backbone system, which can then be used as a basis for future decisions. This
            hightech and sustainable vision of the future would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. But it is
            now becoming reality. Hence, the future is digital only.
