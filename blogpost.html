      With the dawn of 21st century mankind witnessed the greatest invention of its history: the internet. It connected
      the humans of one corner of the earth to those in other corner of it; the fastest medium of connection it has been
      till this day. It was such an influential invention that mankind was bound to opt for it. Very rapidly, trade,
      banking, shopping and even social amusement shifted to internet-based facilities. This all was happening at such
      an enormous pace that even the best legal systems in the world lagged in providing a legal mechanism for keeping
      order. A new form of crime - cybercrime - emerged side by side the massive use of the internet. To cope with this
      new form of crime, laws have been enacted in countries all around the world. In Pakistan, the Prevention of
      Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, (hereinafter PECA) is the recently enacted law for countering almost all forms of
      Cybercrimes. In this article, some major Cybercrimes and their punishments are being discussed

      Cybercrime, In its simplest connotation, means A crime in which a computer or an information technology system is
      either the object of a crime or is a tool for the commission or completion of an offence. The motives behind this
      form of crime range from using Computer Technology for accessing personal information, business or trade secrets
      to the use of the internet for exploitive or malicious purposes. The US department of justice (DoJ) segregates
      cybercrime into three branches: firstly, crimes in which a computing device is the target; secondly, crimes in
      which a computer is used as a weapon; and thirdly crimes in which a computer is used as an accessory to a crime.
      In all categories, the computer is common and it is needless to narrate that the mobile is the modern form of
      computer. Some most common forms of Cybercrimes repeated worldwide are mentioned below, and their relevant
      provisions in the PECA are also explained.

    <h3>1. Electronic Financial Frauds </h3>
    <p>
      It is the most common form of Cybercrime. It includes all fraudulent activities committed through online means for
      gaining illegal financial benefits. According to FIA-issued cybercrime book 20,218 complaints of this category
      were
      registered in the year 2020 alone. Besides what is in black and white, I wonder if anyone is still left in
      Pakistan
      has not yet received a call pretending to be an authorized caller from some Bank or Benazir income support
      programme. Such impersonators usually ask for personal information, Bank codes, or sometimes directly for money.
      In
      most of such cases, prey is illiterate strata of the society. Deceptive online shops or social media pages
      displaying eye-catching offers are also an important medium of digital financial frauds.
      Electronic financial frauds are punishable under section 14 of PECA with imprisonment up to two years or with fine
      which may extend to 10 Million Rupees or with both.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Cyber Stalking</h3>

    <p>

      It is also called cyber harassment. It refers to the use of internet-based facilities with intent to coerce,
      intimidate or harass someone. It includes repeated and unwelcomed messages, unauthorised following on social
      media,
      spying and taking photo or video of a person without his/her consent and disseminating it.
      Such an act is declared an offence under section 24 of PECA. Cyber stalking is punishable with imprisonment of
      maximum three years in jail or with fine up to 1 million or with both. It must be borne in mind that in case the
      victim of cyber stalking is a minor, the term in jail may exceed up to 5 years and the fine to 10 Million Rupees.
      We
      often observe that social media users, mostly unaware of the nature of their act, share and disseminate pictures
      or
      videos of other persons. Such an act, in some cases, may be constructed as an offence of Cyber stalking.
      Law-abiding
      citizens must be vigilant in this regard.

      spying and taking photo or video of a person without his/her consent and disseminating it.

      videos of other persons. Such an act, in some cases, may be constructed as an offence of Cyber stalking.
      Law-abiding
      citizens must be vigilant in this regard.
    </p>
    <h3> 3. Defamation Through Digital Means</h3>
    <p>
      Defamation, whether verbal or written, is an offence under section 499 of Pakistan penal code, 1860. In addition
      to the above-referred provision of law, publication of false information through online means (including websites,
      blogs, Facebook, email or WhatsApp) with intent to harm the reputation of a living person is also made an offence
      under section 20 of PECA.
      The said defamatory act is construed as a violation of the dignity of a person and is held punishable with
      imprisonment for a period which may extend to three years or with a fine of maximum of 10 Million Rupees or with
      both.
      Nowadays, People quite often share their views on social media forums; sometimes express their anger for
      politicians or others, unknown of the fact that they may be held answerable before law. A very recent example that
      can be quoted in this regard is the case against Reham Khan moved by Zulfiqar Bukhari in London. The lady had to
      tender an apology for her comments. one must be very vigilant while posting his views about others on social
      media.

    <h3>4. Cyber Blackmailing Or Publication Of Private Information</h3>
    <p>One May notice that cyber blackmailing is also on the Rise since the mobile phone camera as become a common
      commodity. Recipient of private information like pictures, videos and messages of personal nature sometimes
      misuses the same for achieving his ulterior motives. Buying and selling of electronic devices also cause leakage
      of private info which might be misused by the receiver. In this regard, intentional Exhibition or display of
      sexually explicit pictures or videos of a natural person via any cyber-related means or threatening someone to
      exhibit or display the same is declared offence under Section 21 of PECA, and it is punishable with imprisonment
      up to five years and fine of rupee 5 Million or both. </p>
    </p>
    <h3>5. Hate Speech</h3>
    <p>Another popular form of Cybercrime in our society is hate speech. It may be religious, sectarian or ethnic in
      form. A public speech demonstrated through an information system (social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp,
      Twitter, Instagram etc) that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group of persons based on
      something such as religion or racial hatred is a declared offence under section 11 of PECA and the same is
      punishable with 7 years of imprisonment and fine.
      It must be kept in mind that not just making hate speech is an offence but disseminating such material is also an
      offence covered under section 11 aforesaid.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Cyber Terrorism</h3>
    <p>The offences of (i) unauthorised access to critical infrastructure or data, (ii) unauthorised copying or
      transmission of critical in infrastructure or data, (iii) interference with critical infrastructure system or
      data, or (iv) glorification of any offense, become offence of Cyber terrorism when any of such offence is done
      with one of the following intents:
      (a) coerce, intimidate. create a sense of fear, panic or insecurity in the Government or the public or a section
      of the public or community or sect or create a sense of fear or insecurity in society; or
      (b) advance inter-faith, sectarian or ethnic hatred; or
      (c) advance the objectives of organisations or individuals or groups proscribed under the law.
      The act of Cyber terrorism is punishable under section 10 of PECA, with imprisonment which may extend to 14 years
      or with fine which may extend to 50 million rupees or with both.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Identity Theft</h3>
    <p>Identity theft is a crime in which someone wrongfully obtains a person's personal data or information and uses it
      in a way that involves fraud or deception, typically for wrongful gain. Section 16 of PECA says 'whoever obtains,
      sells, processes, transmits or uses another person's identity information without authorization shall be punished
      with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five million rupees,
      or with both'.
      Besides the above major offences, some cyber techniques are also declared an offence by PECA. these include:
      spamming, spoofing, phishing, hacking, Malware, computer virus transmission, etc. These shall be the subject of
      some future article. Presently, it is concluded that one must be vigilant and responsible enough to avoid
      committing any of the above offences while using the internet, because 'ignorance of law is no excuse'
